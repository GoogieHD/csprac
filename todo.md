# CS2 Practice Queue â€“ Project To-Do

## Completed
- Draft UI synced for all clients
- Session reset
- Final map + server IP display
- **Database integration**
- Login + Register system (including optional admin role)
- Admin Panel (moved to /admin, restricted access)
- Players can't join the lobby until the session is restarted via admin panel
- Team/map voting breaks if a player leaves during the process (due to less than 10 players, causes state reset and session not correctly saving the user)
- Restore session state on refresh
